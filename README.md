# RIPPLE-CARRY
A Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is a simple and widely used digital arithmetic circuit designed to add two multi-bit binary numbers.
It is constructed by connecting several 1-bit full adders in series, where the carry output of each stage is fed into the carry input of the next stage.
The addition starts from the least significant bit, and the carry signal propagates, or “ripples,” through each adder stage until it reaches the most significant bit.
This ripple effect makes the circuit easy to design and implement but also causes a delay that increases with the number of bits. Due to its low hardware cost and straightforward structure, the ripple carry adder is commonly used in basic arithmetic units and as a foundation for more advanced adder designs such as carry look-ahead adders and carry select adders.
